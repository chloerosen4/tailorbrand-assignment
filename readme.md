# Tailorbrands Assignment

Client: https://tailor-client.vercel.app/

Server: https://tailor-sinatra.herokuapp.com/

I've developed a middleware server so the API keys would not be exposed via AJAX requiests.

I've used Sinatra over rails due to the lightweight nature of the server.

I used the Airtable gem to create an ActiveRecord like model which represents the AirTable table.

I've used Angular for the client, unfortunally didn't managed to have the pagination and TailorwindCSS on time. I would have done it by cloning the list `<div>` and hiding it using CSS meta for `min-size`.
